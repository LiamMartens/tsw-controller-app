# TSW Controller App

This UE4SS mod and program allow you to use any joystick to directly control the Train Sim World (5) game. This is NOT a raildriver compatibility layer, rather it uses UE4SS to directly send input values to the train in game.

To get started download the `beta.package.zip` from the release page and follow the `README.md` instructions inside. The software has been tested for stability mostly on Linux but should also work on MacOS.

You can find some demos of me using it below:
